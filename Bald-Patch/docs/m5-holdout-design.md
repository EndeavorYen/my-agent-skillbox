# M5 Holdout Design

M5 tests whether the provisional reviewer-proof `$baldpatch-patch` update
generalizes beyond the six M4 known-failure tasks. M4 is positive but mixed
canary evidence, not final proof.

## Goal

Answer this question:

> Does the provisional skill improve reviewer preference and expected rework
> without raising correctness, underbuild, LOC, or tool-call risk on holdout
> tasks?

## Experimental Arms

Use four arms:

| Arm | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| old skill | Same-day reference for the pre-M5 `$baldpatch-patch` text. |
| provisional skill | Tests the M4-informed reviewer-proof wording. |
| natural-baseline | Measures ordinary agent behavior without Bald Patch. |
| prompt-control | Measures generic anti-overbuild prompt hygiene. |

The old skill arm should use a snapshot of the skill before the provisional M5
edit, not a stale historical artifact.

## Task Suite

Run 12 tasks. Six are M4 known-failure reference tasks and six are holdout tasks
that were not used to derive the M4 rules. This keeps the suite at least half holdout.

The committed M5 suite lives in `evals/tasks/m5/`:

| Public id | Fixture task | Rule area | Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `m5-task-001` | `m5-known-cli-json-flag` | helper extraction | known failure |
| `m5-task-002` | `m5-known-debounce` | timer proof | known failure |
| `m5-task-003` | `m5-known-email-validation` | validation boundaries | known failure |
| `m5-task-004` | `m5-known-native-date-picker` | form defaults | known failure |
| `m5-task-005` | `m5-known-script-dry-run` | output labels | known failure |
| `m5-task-006` | `m5-known-shared-format-helper` | wrapper preservation | known failure |
| `m5-task-007` | `m5-holdout-helper-extraction` | helper extraction | downside |
| `m5-task-008` | `m5-holdout-injected-timer` | timer proof | downside |
| `m5-task-009` | `m5-holdout-safe-report-name` | validation boundaries | downside |
| `m5-task-010` | `m5-holdout-no-default-form` | form defaults | downside |
| `m5-task-011` | `m5-holdout-terse-cli-output` | output labels | downside |
| `m5-task-012` | `m5-holdout-wrapper-collapse` | wrapper preservation | downside |

Include both positive and negative cases for each rule:

| Rule area | Positive case | Downside case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| helper extraction | Tiny branch where a public behavior test is enough. | Repeated logic where helper extraction is justified. |
| timer proof | Debounce or timeout behavior where scoped deterministic timer proof is available. | Behavior where fake timers would obscure real integration timing. |
| validation boundaries | Pragmatic email or identifier validation with clear accepted/rejected boundary. | Validation where a compact regex would underbuild security or compatibility. |
| form defaults | Add a field to form state with existing default serialization. | Add a field where there is no default-state API to prove. |
| output labels | User-facing dry-run or summary output where new data needs a semantic label. | Terse CLI output where extra labels would be noisy or incompatible. |
| wrapper preservation | Shared helper introduced under existing wrapper functions. | Wrapper collapse explicitly requested or clearly reduces duplicate public surface. |

## Primary Gates

M5 should pass only if the provisional skill satisfies all primary gates:

- Correctness is not worse than old skill, natural-baseline, or prompt-control.
- Pairwise reviewer preference beats old skill and prompt-control.
- Reviewer preference is competitive with or better than natural-baseline.
- Median expected rework is not worse than any control arm.
- Underbuild findings are not higher than any control arm.
- Median LOC is not higher than old skill unless reviewer rework decreases.
- Median tool calls are no more than 15% above old skill.
- No holdout task has a unanimous reviewer loss caused by rule overfitting.

## Review Packet

Use blind review with at least three reviewers. The primary packet should include
pairwise comparisons:

- provisional skill vs old skill
- provisional skill vs prompt-control
- provisional skill vs natural-baseline for tasks where the baseline is the
  historical or same-day winner

Reviewers should report preferred patch, confidence, expected rework minutes,
overbuild risk, underbuild risk, dependency judgment, abstraction judgment, and
short reasoning.

## Approval Boundary

Do not run external M5 model work without explicit approval. Fixture code,
prompts, diffs, and reviewer packets may be sent to external Codex/OpenAI
services only after that approval is recorded for M5.

## Decision

If M5 passes, update README from "positive but mixed M4 evidence" to reviewed
M5 evidence and consider broader automation only as a separate issue.

If M5 fails, keep Bald Patch as a docs-first advisory skill, preserve the M5
failure analysis, and do not add hooks, plugins, or stronger automation.
