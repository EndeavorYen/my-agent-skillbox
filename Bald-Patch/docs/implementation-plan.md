# M1 Evaluation Scaffolding Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Build the first deterministic Bald Patch evaluation loop for measuring whether guided Codex patches are smaller, safer, and easier to review.

**Architecture:** M1 is a small Node.js script toolkit with pure functions under CLI wrappers. It records patch metrics and review warnings before any skill, hook, or plugin behavior is added.

**Tech Stack:** Node.js 20 built-ins, `node:test`, Git CLI, Markdown docs, JSONL run records.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Project Positioning

- [x] Replace the placeholder README with Bald Patch positioning, principles, M1 scope, commands, and references.
- [x] Add `package.json` with the project description and no production dependencies.
- [x] Copy the current logo concept into `assets/bald-patch-logo.png`.

### Task 2: Design and Plan Docs

- [x] Write `docs/design.md` from the approved evaluation brief.
- [x] Write this implementation plan in `docs/implementation-plan.md`.
- [x] Create GitHub issues that map to the planned milestones.

### Task 3: Diff Metrics Script

- [x] Write a failing test in `test/diff-metrics.test.mjs` for parsing `git diff --numstat` and `git diff --name-status`.
- [x] Run `npm test` and verify the test fails because the module is missing.
- [x] Implement `scripts/collect-diff-metrics.mjs` with exported pure functions and a CLI.
- [x] Run `npm test` and verify the diff metrics tests pass.

### Task 4: Scope Lint Script

- [x] Write a failing test in `test/scope-lint.test.mjs` for dependency, lockfile, multi-surface, and abstraction warnings.
- [x] Run `npm test` and verify the test fails before implementation.
- [x] Implement `scripts/scope-lint.mjs` with exported pure functions and a CLI.
- [x] Run `npm test` and verify the scope lint tests pass.

### Task 5: M1 Eval Skeleton

- [x] Add 10 smoke task definitions across `evals/tasks/real/` and `evals/tasks/traps/`.
- [x] Add `evals/blind-review-template.md`.
- [x] Add empty `evals/runs/` and `evals/reports/` placeholders.
- [x] Run `npm test`.

### Task 6: Verification

- [x] Run `npm test`.
- [x] Run `node scripts/collect-diff-metrics.mjs --base main --json`.
- [x] Run `node scripts/scope-lint.mjs --base main --json`.
- [x] Inspect `rtk git status --short`.
- [x] Summarize what changed, what was verified, and what remains.

### Task 7: Issue #2 Score and Report Generation

- [x] Write a failing test in `test/score-run.test.mjs` for JSONL parsing, by-arm summaries, hard gate failures, and regression warnings.
- [x] Run `npm test` and verify the test fails because `scripts/score-run.mjs` is missing.
- [x] Implement `scripts/score-run.mjs` with exported pure functions and a CLI.
- [x] Run `npm test` and verify the score-run tests pass.
- [x] Document the scoring command in `README.md`.

### Task 8: Remaining Issue Support

- [x] Add `$baldpatch-review` advisory skill and deterministic review script for #4.
- [x] Add non-blocking Stop hook metrics wrapper and docs for #5.
- [x] Add docs-first installation and packaging gates for #6.
- [x] Add M1 A/B run queue generation and eval runbook for #1 without fabricating results.
- [x] Add resettable standalone fixtures and verifier wiring so #1 can run honest baseline/skill checkouts.
- [x] Add an explicit local runner that can preview runs safely and append JSONL only when an approved agent command is provided.
- [x] Add blocked-run recording and reporting so unavailable agent runs are documented without pretending to pass.

## Self-Review

- Spec coverage: M1 covers positioning, docs, deterministic instrumentation, task skeletons, and reviewer flow.
- Placeholder scan: No implementation placeholders are intended to remain in checked-in docs. Open checklist items describe work in progress for this turn.
- Scope check: Marketplace packaging and blocking automation remain outside M1 until the smoke eval shows value. The explicit skills and optional non-blocking Stop hook are docs-first follow-ons tracked through the current issues.
