# M1 A/B Eval Runbook

This runbook is the honest path for issue #1. It builds the 20-run queue from the 10 task definitions, then records real Codex baseline and `$baldpatch-patch` runs.

Do not hand-edit fake successful runs into `evals/runs/`. If a task cannot be run, record it as blocked with the reason.

## 1. Generate The Run Queue

```bash
node scripts/run-ab.mjs --jsonl > /private/tmp/bald-patch-ab-plan.jsonl
```

This emits one baseline and one skill prompt for every task. Baseline prompts do not mention `$baldpatch-patch`; skill prompts start with `$baldpatch-patch`. Each JSONL row includes `fixture_project` and `fixture_verify` so the run can be tied back to a resettable fixture.

For a safer orchestration preview, use:

```bash
node scripts/run-m1-eval.mjs --task parser-edge-case --arm baseline
```

This prints the planned checkout path, prompt path, verify command, and rendered agent command if one is provided. It does not run an agent or write eval records unless `--execute` is passed.

## 2. Run Each Task In A Fixture Checkout

For each JSONL row:

1. Prepare or reset the fixture repo for that task:

```bash
node scripts/prepare-fixture.mjs \
  --task native-date-picker \
  --out /private/tmp/bald-patch-m1/native-date-picker-baseline \
  --force
```

The prepare command copies only the fixture project, initializes a git base commit, and prints the matching verify command.

2. Run Codex from the prepared fixture checkout with the row prompt.
3. Run the task's verification command from the Bald Patch repo:

```bash
node scripts/verify-fixture.mjs \
  --task native-date-picker \
  --cwd /private/tmp/bald-patch-m1/native-date-picker-baseline
```

The verifier first runs the fixture's public tests, then hidden acceptance tests from this repo.

4. Collect metrics from the prepared fixture checkout:

```bash
node /path/to/Bald-Patch/scripts/collect-diff-metrics.mjs --base main --json
node /path/to/Bald-Patch/scripts/scope-lint.mjs --base main --json
```

5. Append a JSONL run record to `evals/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-m1-smoke.jsonl`.

Do not collect metrics from the Bald Patch repo itself; collect them from the fixture checkout that Codex edited.

## 3. Required Run Record Fields

Required fields:

```json
{"run_id":"2026-06-17-native-date-picker-baseline","task_id":"native-date-picker","arm":"baseline","model":"codex","success":true,"tests_passed":true,"requirements_met":true,"files_changed":4,"lines_added":70,"lines_deleted":10,"dependencies_added":["date-picker-lib"],"tool_calls":10,"elapsed_ms":100000,"scope_violations":["dependency-file-changed"],"human_rework_minutes":2,"reviewer_preferred":false}
```

## 4. Optional Local Runner

`run-m1-eval` can execute one or more rows and append records:

```bash
node scripts/run-m1-eval.mjs \
  --task parser-edge-case \
  --arm baseline \
  --out-root /private/tmp/bald-patch-m1 \
  --record evals/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-m1-smoke.jsonl \
  --agent-command 'your-agent --cwd {fixture} --prompt-file {promptFile}' \
  --execute
```

Supported placeholders are `{fixture}`, `{promptFile}`, `{artifactDir}`, `{runId}`, `{task}`, and `{arm}`. Values are shell-quoted before substitution.

Only use a Codex or hosted-model command here after explicitly approving the external data transfer. If a run cannot be executed, do not create a fake success row; record it as blocked in a separate note or rerun when the approved command is available.

To append blocked records for rows that cannot be executed yet:

```bash
node scripts/run-m1-eval.mjs \
  --task parser-edge-case \
  --arm baseline \
  --record evals/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-m1-smoke.jsonl \
  --record-blocked \
  --blocker "external Codex execution was not approved"
```

Blocked rows are excluded from scored arm summaries and shown in a separate report section. They are evidence that the eval is incomplete, not a passing result.

## 5. Score The Runs

```bash
node scripts/score-run.mjs \
  --input evals/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-m1-smoke.jsonl \
  --output evals/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-m1-smoke.md \
  --title "Bald Patch M1 Eval Report - YYYY-MM-DD"
```

## 6. Build And Decode Blind Review

Collect reviewer answers using the matching blind review packet and answer template. Do not show reviewers the run records, arm names, or mapping key before they answer.

The mapping key should stay outside the repo, for example:

```bash
/private/tmp/bald-patch-m1-codex-blind-key.json
```

Build the packet from completed successful run checkouts:

```bash
node scripts/build-blind-review-packet.mjs \
  --mode m2 \
  --runs evals/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-m2.jsonl \
  --checkouts /private/tmp/bald-patch-m2/checkouts \
  --output-packet evals/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-m2-blind-review.md \
  --output-key /private/tmp/bald-patch-m2-blind-key.json
```

The packet contains public task ids, request text, anonymized patch labels, and diffs. The key contains the private run id, arm, and model mapping.

After answers are collected, decode them and write a reviewed run file:

```bash
node scripts/apply-blind-review.mjs \
  --runs evals/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-m2.jsonl \
  --key /private/tmp/bald-patch-m2-blind-key.json \
  --answers evals/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-m2-reviewer-1.json \
  --answers evals/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-m2-reviewer-2.json \
  --answers evals/reviews/YYYY-MM-DD-m2-reviewer-3.json \
  --output-runs evals/runs/YYYY-MM-DD-m2-reviewed.jsonl \
  --output-summary evals/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-m2-blind-review.md
```

Each answer file may either be a raw array of answers or an object with `reviewer_id` and `answers`. Rich answers should include a `patches` object keyed by patch label so `score-run` can report reviewer preference, median expected rework, agreement, and underbuild findings.

Then rerun `score-run` against the reviewed JSONL so reviewer preference, reviewer agreement, expected rework, and underbuild gates are computed from decoded preferences.

## 7. Interpret

M1 is useful only if:

- correctness is not worse than baseline
- median LOC changed drops 20% or more
- unnecessary dependency additions drop 50% or more
- median tool calls do not increase more than 15%
- blind reviewer preference is 60% or more for Bald Patch

If Bald Patch produces smaller diffs but more human rework, treat the result as a failure signal.
